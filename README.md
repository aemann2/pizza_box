# [Pizza Box](https://aemann2.github.io/pizza_box/)

A website for a fictional pizza vending machine. This was originally a Free Code Camp project that I wanted to have a little fun with...I chose the most ridiculous concept I could think of, which turned out to be a semi-real product (which is where I got the image and the video).

## Background:

This was my first real webpage that I thought looked somewhat professional. It's not perfect -- for example, I hadn't yet learned SASS and didn't even know what BEM was when I made it, so the CSS is much too verbose and there are too many wayward classes and inefficiencies of that kind. But I like the styling, and I think it's just funny. I'm choosing to leave some of the rough edges so I can look back one day when I'm a few years into my career and see where I was at with this project.

## Technology:

Pretty much plain ol' HTML and CSS.

## What I learned or used for the first time:

- **Github for version control**
- **Git branching**
- **Markdown for project planning**
- **Smooth scrolling**
- **A transparent nav bar w/ a z-index**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Animation: filter, transition, scale, transform**
- **Custom-made cards**
- **SVG background images**
- **Responsive design**

...I used a ton of things for the first time here, and this project was like a sandbox for everything I was learning.
